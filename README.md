# DeFi Guardian â€“ Autonomous Risk Manager & Yield Optimizer

DeFi Guardian is an autonomous agent built using the Olas Stack that monitors market conditions, assesses portfolio risk, and dynamically rebalances assets to maximize yield. It integrates with staking contracts via the Olas SDK and is fully registered on the Olas Registry.


## Overview
DeFi Guardian automates risk management and yield optimization in decentralized finance (DeFi). It leverages advanced AI/ML algorithms to analyze market data and adjust portfolio allocations, while also interacting with staking contracts to manage rewards. The agent is designed to be fully interoperable within the Olas ecosystem, ensuring discoverability and seamless integration.

## Features
